# Modular exponentiation (Recursive)




Given three numbers a, b and c, we need to find (ab) % c

Now why do “% c” after exponentiation, because ab will be really large even for relatively small values of a, b and that is a problem because the data type of the language that we try to code the problem, will most probably not let us store such a large number.
